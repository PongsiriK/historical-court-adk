**Verdict: Thomas Edison**

Thomas Edison was a towering figure in American innovation, a prolific inventor and astute businessman whose work profoundly reshaped the modern industrialized world. Born in 1847, he is credited with developing numerous devices that had a widespread impact on daily life and industry. His career was marked by both groundbreaking scientific achievement and aggressive business strategies, leaving a complex and enduring legacy.

**Achievements (Admirer's Perspective):**
Thomas Edison was an exceptionally prolific American inventor and businessman whose innovations dramatically influenced the modern industrialized world. His genius manifested in the development of groundbreaking devices across various fields, including electric power generation, sound recording (such as the phonograph), and motion pictures (like the motion picture camera), alongside crucial early versions of the electric light bulb. Edison is also celebrated for pioneering the application of organized science and teamwork to the invention process, establishing the first industrial research laboratory and accumulating an impressive 1,093 US patents, a testament to his inventive spirit and entrepreneurial drive.

**Controversies (Critic's Perspective):**
However, Edison's legacy is also tarnished by controversial business practices, particularly during the infamous "War of the Currents." During this period, his company actively sought to discredit alternating current (AC) technology, often by falsely claiming it was hazardous and inferior to his direct current (DC) system. In a highly unethical campaign, Edison, in collaboration with Harold P. Brown, publicly demonstrated the supposed dangers of AC by electrocuting animals to sway public opinion against it. Furthermore, they conspired with a rival company to ensure that the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator, a cynical tactic explicitly aimed at associating AC with death and capital punishment.

**Conclusion:**
Thomas Edison stands as a monumental figure whose inventive brilliance unquestionably propelled technological advancement and shaped the conveniences of modern life. His contributions to electricity, communication, and entertainment were transformative and continue to impact society today. However, his relentless pursuit of commercial dominance often led him to engage in morally questionable and aggressive business tactics, most notably during the "War of the Currents." This duality presents Edison as both a visionary genius and a controversial businessman. His historical impact is thus a testament to the power of innovation, alongside a cautionary tale about the ethical dimensions of competition and technological adoption.
